“If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you’re mis-informed.”

“Out of all the things I have lost, I miss my mind the most.”

“It is better to deserve honors and not have them than to have them and not deserve them.”
It’s better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than open it and remove all doubt
It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.
