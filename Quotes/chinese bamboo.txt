excellent thought on patience by rahul dravid
you can take a chinese bamboo seed and plant it in the ground, water and nurture the seed for an entire year and not even a single sprout. In fact, you wil not see a sprout for 5 years.
but suddenly, a tiny shoot will spring from the ground and over the next 6 week the plant can grow as tall as 90 feet. it can grow as fast as 39 inches every 24 hours. you can literally watch the plant grow.
what was the plant doing for these 5 years. seemingly dormant period, it was growing its root. for full five years it was preparing for rapid, full growth.
without this root structure, the plant simpy couldn't simply support itself for its future growth.
some would say it grew in 90 feet in 6 weeks.. i would say it grew 90 feet in 5 years 6 week. so keep watering and nurturing yourself. one day you will sprout and may be grow as fast as a chinese bamboo tree. no one becomes a midnight success, there are years of labor and pain behind that.
God'd delays are not god's denials
